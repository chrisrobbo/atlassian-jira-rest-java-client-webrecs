Please see project documentation at https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JRJC/.

In order to start JIRA please execute atlas-debug from test directory.

If you want contribute to project feel free to send pull request (preferably with tests ;)).

IMPORTANT: please do not touch the rest_api_guard branch - master is being auto-merged to that branch
so there is no need to do any changes there (doing so will cause conflicts).
